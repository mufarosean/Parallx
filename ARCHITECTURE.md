## Canvas Registry Gate Architecture

The canvas built-in (`src/built-in/canvas/`) has its own internal dependency structure enforced through **five registries** that act as gates. This architecture was established across 20+ commits to eliminate a tangled dependency graph where files imported freely from each other.

### Core Principle

> **Children talk only to their parent gate. Gates go to the source. No shortcuts.**

A "child" is any file that belongs to a registry's domain (e.g. `slashMenu.ts` is a child of CanvasMenuRegistry). A "gate" is a registry that mediates all imports for its children. Children never reach across to a sibling registry — they get everything they need through their own gate's re-exports.

**Gate-to-gate rule:** When a gate needs something from another gate, it imports from the gate that **owns** the symbol — never through an intermediate gate that merely passes it through. If IconRegistry owns `svgIcon`, HandleRegistry imports from IconRegistry directly, not from BlockRegistry. This eliminates phantom dependencies and keeps the import graph honest.

### The Five Gates

```

   HandleRegistry, CanvasMenuRegistry also import from
   IconRegistry and BlockStateRegistry directly (go to source).
```

### 1. IconRegistry (`config/iconRegistry.ts`)

**Role:** Single gate for all icon/SVG access. Only file that imports `canvasIcons.ts`.

**Exports:** `svgIcon()`, `createIconElement()`, `resolvePageIcon()`, `PAGE_SELECTABLE_ICONS`, `ALL_ICON_IDS`, `isBlockIconSelectable()`

**Consumers:** Only four — BlockRegistry, CanvasMenuRegistry, HandleRegistry, and any future gate that needs icon functions. Each imports directly from IconRegistry (the source owner).

### 2. BlockRegistry (`config/blockRegistry.ts`)

**Role:** Single source of truth for block metadata, capabilities, and extension factories.

**Re-exports from IconRegistry:** `svgIcon`, `resolvePageIcon`, `createIconElement` (for its children)

**Re-exports from BlockStateRegistry:** All mutation/movement/column/drag-session exports, 30+ symbols (for its children)

**Re-exports from header/pageChrome:** `PageChromeController` (for canvasEditorProvider — the orchestrator)

**Own API:** `BLOCK_REGISTRY`, `BlockDefinition`, `PAGE_CONTAINERS`, `COLUMN_CONTENT_EXPRESSION`, `getBlockExtensions()`, `getSlashMenuBlocks()`, `getTurnIntoBlocks()`, `getBlockLabel()`, `getBlockByName()`, `isContainerBlockType()`, `getNodePlaceholder()`, `createEditorExtensions()`

**Children (8 files):**
- Block extensions: `calloutNode`, `columnNodes`, `mediaNodes`, `bookmarkNode`, `pageBlockNode`
- Chrome/sidebar: `pageChrome`, `canvasSidebar`
- Assembly: `tiptapExtensions`

### 3. CanvasMenuRegistry (`menus/canvasMenuRegistry.ts`)

**Role:** Centralized menu lifecycle — mutual exclusion, outside-click dismissal, interaction arbitration, block-data access for menus.

**Re-exports from BlockStateRegistry (source owner):** `applyBackgroundColorToBlock`, `applyTextColorToBlock`, `deleteBlockAt`, `duplicateBlockAt`, `turnBlockWithSharedStrategy` (for its children)

**Re-exports from BlockRegistry (source owner):** `InsertActionContext`, `InsertActionBaseContext`, `getSlashMenuBlocks`, `getTurnIntoBlocks`, `getBlockLabel`, `getBlockByName`, `BLOCK_REGISTRY`

**Re-exports from IconRegistry (source owner):** `svgIcon`, `PAGE_SELECTABLE_ICONS`

**Own API:** `ICanvasMenu`, `IBlockActionMenu`, `MenuBlockInfo`, `CanvasMenuRegistry` class

**Children (6+ files):** `slashMenu`, `bubbleMenu`, `blockActionMenu`, `iconMenu`, `coverMenu`, `inlineMathEditor`, `imageInsertPopup`, `mediaInsertPopup`, `bookmarkInsertPopup`

No menu child imports from BlockRegistry directly — they get everything through CanvasMenuRegistry.

### 4. BlockStateRegistry (`config/blockStateRegistry/blockStateRegistry.ts`)

**Role:** Two-way gate facade for block mutations, movements, column operations, and drag state. Decomposed from a single 718-line `blockMutations.ts` into 8 focused child modules.

**Inward gate (from BlockRegistry → children):** `PAGE_CONTAINERS`, `isContainerBlockType`

**Outward gate (from children → BlockRegistry):** All exports from `blockLifecycle`, `blockTransforms`, `blockMovement`, `columnCreation`, `columnInvariants`, `crossPageMovement`, `dragSession`, plus column/resize plugins.

**Internal children (8 files):**
- `blockLifecycle.ts` — create, destroy, restyle
- `blockTransforms.ts` — turn-into type conversions
- `blockMovement.ts` — keyboard + DnD positional changes
- `columnCreation.ts` — column layout assembly
- `columnInvariants.ts` — structural rules (empty-check, normalize, dissolve)
- `crossPageMovement.ts` — async cross-page block transfer
- `dragSession.ts` — shared drag state channel
- `blockStateRegistry.ts` — two-way gate facade

Children import from `blockStateRegistry.ts` (their gate), never from `blockRegistry.ts` or each other directly.

### 5. HandleRegistry (`handles/handleRegistry.ts`)

**Role:** Gate for block-handle interaction controllers. Mediates imports so handle children never reach into other registries directly.

**Re-exports from BlockRegistry (source owner):** `PAGE_CONTAINERS`, `isContainerBlockType`

**Re-exports from IconRegistry (source owner):** `svgIcon`

**Re-exports from BlockStateRegistry (source owner):** `CANVAS_BLOCK_DRAG_MIME`, `clearActiveCanvasDragSession`, `setActiveCanvasDragSession`

**Re-exports from CanvasMenuRegistry (source owner):** `IBlockActionMenu`

**Children (2 files):** `blockHandles`, `blockSelection`

Handle children import from `handleRegistry.ts` only — never from blockRegistry, canvasMenuRegistry, or each other's paths directly.

### Gate-to-Gate Import Edges (enforced by compliance test)

| Gate | Imports from | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **IconRegistry** | (none) | Leaf gate — all icons originate here |
| **BlockRegistry** | IconRegistry, BlockStateRegistry | Re-exports icons and mutations for its children |
| **CanvasMenuRegistry** | BlockRegistry, IconRegistry, BlockStateRegistry | Block data from owner, icons from owner, mutations from owner |
| **BlockStateRegistry** | BlockRegistry | Inward gate: `PAGE_CONTAINERS`, `isContainerBlockType` |
| **HandleRegistry** | BlockRegistry, IconRegistry, BlockStateRegistry, CanvasMenuRegistry | Each symbol from its source owner |

### Gate Isolation Invariants

These invariants are **absolute** — violations break the architecture:

| Invariant | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Icon gate** | No non-registry file imports from `iconRegistry.ts`. Icons flow through parent gates. Peer gates import from IconRegistry directly (source owner). |
| **Menu gate** | No menu child imports from `blockRegistry.ts`. All block data (labels, definitions, mutations) flows through CanvasMenuRegistry. |
| **Extension gate** | No block extension imports from `canvasMenuRegistry.ts`. Extensions get everything from BlockRegistry. |
| **Go to source** | Gate-to-gate imports target the gate that **owns** the symbol. No intermediate pass-throughs. Enforced by `gateCompliance.test.ts`. |
| **No cycles** | Gate-to-gate graph must be acyclic, with one permitted exception: BlockRegistry ↔ BlockStateRegistry (safe `export { } from` live re-exports only, no evaluation-time reads). Enforced by a dedicated cycle safety test. |
| **State gate** | No BlockStateRegistry child imports from `blockRegistry.ts` directly. Dependencies flow inward through `blockStateRegistry.ts`. |
| **Handle gate** | No handle child imports from `blockRegistry.ts` or `canvasMenuRegistry.ts`. Dependencies flow through HandleRegistry. |
| **No cross-reach** | Children never import across registries. A menu file cannot import from a block extension file, and vice versa. |

### Why This Matters

The circular dependency that broke column editing (`978539d`) was caused by exactly this kind of cross-reach: `blockRegistry → columnNodes → blockCapabilities → blockRegistry`. The gate architecture prevents this class of bug entirely — every dependency is mediated by a gate, every gate has a clear direction, and esbuild's IIFE bundling order becomes irrelevant because gates defer reads to runtime.

- Abstract editor pane (content rendering)
- Editor-related types

### `workspace/`
**Workspace identity, state persistence, and switching.**
- Workspace identity model (ID, name, metadata)
- Workspace state loading from storage
- Workspace state saving to storage
- Workspace-related types

### `commands/`
**Command registration, lookup, and execution.**
- Command registry with metadata and when-clause preconditions
- Command type definitions and interfaces
- Structural commands (toggle sidebar, split editor, resize, etc.)

### `context/`
**Structural context tracking and conditional evaluation.**
- Context key definitions and API
- Context key evaluation engine
- Workbench context model (active part, focused view, visibility)
- Focus tracker (active view/part/region tracking)
- When-clause expression parser

### `dnd/`
**Drag-and-drop coordination for views and editors.**
- Drag-and-drop coordination logic
- Drop zone rendering and hit detection
- Visual drop overlay feedback
- Drag-and-drop types

### `tools/`
**Tool discovery, validation, activation, and isolation.**
- Manifest schema and validation (`parallx-manifest.schema.json`, `toolManifest.ts`, `toolValidator.ts`)
- Tool scanning from filesystem (`toolScanner.ts`)
- Tool module loading (`toolModuleLoader.ts`)
- Registry of discovered and activated tools (`toolRegistry.ts`)
- Activation event matching (`activationEventService.ts`)
- Tool activation lifecycle (`toolActivator.ts`)
- Error isolation to prevent tool crashes from affecting the shell (`toolErrorIsolation.ts`)

### `api/`
**Public API surface exposed to tool extensions.**
- API factory that creates scoped `parallx.*` namespaces per tool (`apiFactory.ts`)
- API type definitions for tools (`parallx.d.ts`)
- API version validation (`apiVersionValidation.ts`)
- Notification, input box, and quick pick UI (`notificationService.ts`)
- Bridge modules connecting API calls to internal services (`bridges/`)

### `configuration/`
**Configuration schema registration and tool-scoped storage.**
- Configuration registry for tool-contributed settings (`configurationRegistry.ts`)
- Configuration service for reading/writing values (`configurationService.ts`)
- Per-tool memento storage with quota enforcement (`toolMemento.ts`)
- Configuration types (`configurationTypes.ts`)

### `contributions/`
**Processing of tool manifest contribution points.**
- Command registration from manifests (`commandContribution.ts`)
- Keybinding registration from manifests (`keybindingContribution.ts`)
- Menu contribution processing (`menuContribution.ts`)
- Shared contribution types (`contributionTypes.ts`)

### `built-in/`
**First-party features shipped with the workbench (not loaded as tools).**
- `welcome/` — Welcome tab shown on startup with start actions (New File, Open File, Open Folder) and recent workspaces/files
- `editor/` — Built-in editor panes for system UIs:
  - Keyboard shortcuts viewer (`keybindingsEditorInput.ts`, `keybindingsEditorPane.ts`) — searchable table of all registered keybindings
  - Settings editor (`settingsEditorInput.ts`, `settingsEditorPane.ts`) — grouped, searchable settings with type-appropriate controls (checkbox, select, number, text)
- `explorer/` — Built-in file explorer view
- `output/` — Output panel view
- `tool-gallery/` — Tool discovery and installation view

> Built-in features follow the same `EditorInput` / `EditorPane` patterns as tool-contributed editors.
> They may depend on `platform`, `services` (interfaces), `editor` (abstract base classes), and `configuration`.

### `electron/`
**Electron main process and preload bridge (outside `src/`).**
- `main.cjs` — Window creation, native menu, lifecycle management, IPC handlers
  - Intercepts window close (`lifecycle:beforeClose` → renderer) to allow unsaved-changes prompts
  - Confirms close via `lifecycle:confirmClose` IPC from renderer
- `preload.cjs` — Context bridge exposing `window.parallxElectron` API to the renderer
  - `onBeforeClose(callback)` — registers listener for close interception
  - `confirmClose()` — signals main process to proceed with window close
  - File system, dialog, and shell helpers

> Renderer code must **never** use `ipcRenderer` directly — all IPC goes through the preload bridge.

### `ui/`
**Reusable UI primitives shared across feature modules.**
- Mirrors VS Code's `src/vs/base/browser/ui/` pattern
- Components: `inputBox`, `contextMenu`, `button`, `overlay`, `list`, `breadcrumbs`, `tabBar`, `dialog`, `findReplaceWidget`
- DOM helpers: `$()` element factory, `addDisposableListener()`, visibility toggles, drag helpers
- All components extend `Disposable`, accept `(container, options?)`, use co-located CSS
- Context-agnostic — components don't know which part hosts them

> `ui/` may depend on `platform/` only (events, lifecycle, types).

### Rules in Plain Language

1. **`platform` depends on nothing.** It is the foundational layer.
2. **`ui` depends only on `platform`.** Reusable UI primitives. Mirrors VS Code's `base/browser/ui/`.
3. **`layout` depends on `platform` and `ui`.** Grid and layout logic uses UI primitives (VS Code: grid IS in `base/browser/ui/grid/`).
4. **`parts` depend on `platform`, `ui`, `layout`, `editor`, and service interfaces.** EditorPart integrates with EditorGroupView at runtime — mirroring VS Code's `EditorPart` → `EditorGroupView` pattern.
5. **`views` depend on `platform`, `ui`, `layout`, and service interfaces.** Views participate in layout but don't know about parts or editors.
6. **`editor` depends on `platform`, `ui`, `layout`, `views`, and service interfaces.** Editors extend view concepts but don't depend on parts directly.
7. **`workspace` depends on `platform`, `layout`†, `views`†, `parts`† (type-only), and service interfaces.** Workspace serialization references layout models, view descriptors, and part types for state persistence.
8. **`commands` depend on `platform`, `context`, and service interfaces.** Commands evaluate context and call services — never import concrete editor/part/built-in types.
9. **`context` depends on `platform` and service interfaces.** Context is a data tracking layer.
10. **`dnd` depends on `platform`, `ui`, `layout`, `views`, and service interfaces.** DnD coordinates view movement through layout.
11. **`tools` depend on `platform`, `api`, `configuration`, and service interfaces.** Tool lifecycle management loads, validates, and activates tools.
12. **`api` depends on `platform`, `ui`, `layout`, `views`, `editor`, `commands`, `context`, `configuration`, `tools`† (type-only), `contributions`† (type-only), and service interfaces.** API bridges connect tool calls to internal services; the factory imports tool manifest types and contribution processor types.
13. **`configuration` depends on `platform` and service interfaces.** Configuration is a data/schema concern.
14. **`contributions` depend on `platform`, `ui`, `views`, `commands`, `context`, `tools`† (type-only), and service interfaces.** Contributions process manifest declarations into registered entities.
15. **`services` depend on `platform` and may import from any module** to provide concrete implementations behind interfaces.
16. **`workbench` is the composition root.** It may depend on everything to wire the system together.

### Absolute Prohibitions

- **No circular dependencies.** If module A imports from module B, module B must not import from module A (directly or transitively).
- **No upward dependencies.** Lower layers (`platform`, `layout`) must never import from higher layers (`workbench`, `services` implementations).
- **No cross-peer dependencies unless explicitly allowed.** For example, `parts` must not import from `views`, `editor`, `workspace`, `commands`, `context`, or `dnd`.
- **No concrete service imports outside `services/` and `workbench/`.** All other modules consume services through interfaces only.

## Conventions

- **One concern per file.** Each file has a single, clear responsibility described in its header comment.
- **Types files are co-located.** Each module has a `*Types.ts` file for shared type definitions within that module.
- **Interfaces before implementations.** Service interfaces live in `services/serviceTypes.ts`; implementations live alongside them in `services/`.
- **Test files mirror source structure.** Tests for `src/layout/grid.ts` live at `tests/layout/grid.test.ts` (when testing is introduced).
