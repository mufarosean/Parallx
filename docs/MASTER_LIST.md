# Master List: app improvements and future extensions

The one place future work is tracked. Started 2026-11-09 as the canon for
the next month. An idea goes here when Mufaro says so, with his words on
it; it leaves when it ships (a line in the doc it shipped into) or when he
drops it. Nothing on this list is agreed to be built until he says go on
that item; the list is the queue, not the plan.

How to read an entry: what it is, what the user gets, what exists today,
and what is unknown (a licence, a size, a bar not yet researched).

The sections, by his rule (2026-11-09): improvements to surfaces that
already exist, UI improvements, and completely new extensions are kept
apart, so a month's plan can be read by kind. Verification he is owed and
ideas he has heard and set aside come last.

## Existing surfaces: improvements

Changes to what is already there: a tool, a pane, a prompt, a pipeline.

### Worksheets: a full redesign, generalized

**His words (2026-11-09):** "a full redesign of worksheets. A lot of what
I built for it, I built specifically for studying for exam 7. we need to
generalize, improve it quite a bit, etc."

**Status (2026-11-10):** agreed, it will be done. His words: "Worksheets
full redesign we will do, but we will not start with it today." Not
started; the bar research below still comes first.

**What exists today (verified from the file list).** `src/built-in/worksheet`
is two things grown together. One is a spreadsheet tool: the Univer host
(lazy bundle, one engine per window), formulas and references, display
numbers, equation images, Excel import and xlsx export, a sidebar, a
worksheet block for pages. The other is a study program built on top of
it for Exam 7: the Problem Bank and its filters, problem import, recipes,
practice sessions and their config and run panes, quizzes, the review
pane, the campaign, the day plan, the roster, rewards and their sync, the
study clock, progress insights, solution visibility, a Generate pane that
writes problems with a model. The manifest's sidebar title is Worksheets;
much of the surface is the bank.

**Direction.** Separate the two along the first principle. The
spreadsheet stays a general tool anyone uses for any table. The study
program becomes what it is, a study tool, generic in its nouns (items,
sets, sessions, a plan, progress) so it serves any exam, course or
skill, and lives where a user can turn it on or off without losing the
spreadsheet. Nothing in either names Exam 7, the CAS or his readings;
his data keeps working through the same generic shapes. The redesign is
the moment to raise the spreadsheet's own quality (he said "improve it
quite a bit").

**Bar to research first.** For the spreadsheet: what a person expects
from a sheet in a notes app (Notion databases, Coda tables, Excel's
core) and where Univer already gets there. For the study program: the
practice tools he rates (his Rising Fellow materials, Anki's sessions)
and the shape of a session, a bank and a plan that is domain-free. Get
his yes on both lists before building; see the research-the-bar rule.

**Unknown.** Whether the study half becomes its own built-in or an
extension; how much of the Exam 7 data model (recipes, roster, campaign)
generalizes and how much is his alone and stays in his workspace; the
migration of his existing banks and sessions.

## UI improvements

How the app looks and moves: new surfaces, polish of existing ones, the
feel of browsing. His gate for Voice ("improve the surfaces a bit more,
make the app feel more polished") is met by work in this section.

Shipped 2026-11-10, on his picks from the mock-ups (each is in the code
and its tests; nothing more is queued on them):

- **File explorer tree.** The registry chevron in place of the text
  glyph, the folder icon open or closed, faint indent guides, the same
  chevron on the section headers. File-type icons untouched.
- **Three sidebar icons.** Creations AI a storybook, Browser a window,
  Worksheets the calculator.
- **Tools and Search out of the sidebar.** Tools and Extensions is an
  editor tab from the View menu. Ctrl+F is one Find surface: this
  document first (text, PDF, and now canvas pages, databases and any
  tool's editor), with a switch to Workspace that the Search tool adds
  while it runs; results sit under the field. Ctrl+Shift+F opens it on
  Workspace.
- **Home, first version.** The Parallx icon opens it: search, a chip per
  tool and per tag, recent items as cards or a list. Tools feed it
  through `registerHomeSource` (`api.home.registerSource` for
  extensions). Pages and files feed it today.

### Home: what is left

His design is agreed (2026-11-10: "aligned with home design"). Not done
in the first version:

- **The extensions' own items.** Creations AI (characters, chats,
  lorebooks), Budget, Flashcards, the Media Organizer and the rest each
  need a source of their own, written in the extension. Until then Home
  shows pages and files only.
- **The written summary.** A card's line is the item's opening words
  today. His words were "an automatic one-line summary": a summary the
  model writes once per item and keeps, through the core's
  language-models service. Unknown: where it is stored, and when it is
  refreshed.
- **Tags.** Home shows the tags a source gives; pages and files give
  none yet.
- **Launch.** Home opens from the icon; the Welcome page still opens on
  first launch. Not asked: whether Home takes its place.

### Text arrows elsewhere

Found while replacing the explorer's: the same dated text glyphs (▾ ▸ ▼
▶) remain in the dropdown component, the chat's tool-result caret, its
context pills and token bar, the tool detail page's sections and two
canvas property pickers. Not raised with him; recorded so it is not
forgotten.

## New extensions

Completely new tools, each its own extension in `ext/`, on or off by the
user. All four came from the Papers With Code read of 2026-11-09.
Licences are not checked for any of them; that is the first step of each.

### Read Anything: a better local reader for scans and photos of pages

**His question:** how is this different from nomic? **Answer:**
nomic-embed-text embeds text that already exists so it can be searched;
it cannot read a scan. Reading a scan is extraction, which Parallx does
through Docling, with an optional OCR pipeline (`docling-ocr` in
`documentExtractionService.ts`). So the loop exists. What the new models
add is the quality and the cost of that OCR step: Indra OCR is a
1M-parameter ONNX model that runs on CPU with no PyTorch, reads
handwriting, 80+ languages and pages at any angle, and returns Markdown,
text or JSON with boxes; MiniCPM-OCR 1.0 (1.3B) and Xiaomi-OCR-0 (0.8B)
are the heavier tier for tables, formulas and charts.

**What the user gets.** Any scan or photo of a page becomes searchable
text with boxes that click back to the spot on the page; handwriting
included. For him: scanned exam papers, the closing documents. For
another person: receipts into Budget, medical letters, warranties.

**Shape.** An extraction provider the indexing pipeline can prefer over
the Docling OCR pipeline for images and scanned PDFs, plus the box data
kept so a search hit can highlight the page. Measure against Docling's
OCR on his own scans before deciding it replaces anything.

**Unknown.** Licences; whether Indra's quality on his scans beats
Docling's; the CPU time per page.

### Voice, both ways, local (after the surfaces are polished)

**His words:** "I do have interest in adding voice, just not quite yet. I
feel like I need to improve the surfaces a bit more, make the app feel
more polished before going to voice."

**What it is.** Qwen3-ASR (0.6B and 1.7B): speech recognition plus
forced alignment (word timestamps). Qwen3-TTS and Breeze TTS 2: voice
design from a plain description, cloning from a short sample, streaming.
The extension: dictate into a page; read a page or a flashcard deck
aloud; in Creations, give each character a described voice so a chat can
be heard; transcripts of his own recordings linked to the moment.

**Gate.** Polish first, by his call. Not started until he reopens it.

**Unknown.** Licences; VRAM beside a loaded chat model; which TTS reads
best in his ear (his real-model rule applies).

### Predict From This Table

**His words:** "This one I find interesting. Forecasting budget or
habits."

**What it is.** TabPFN-3.5, a tabular foundation model that forecasts and
classifies on small tables with no training step. The extension: an
action in Worksheets and Tables that fills a column from the others, or
forecasts the next points of a time series, with the uncertainty shown.
Budget's ledger forecast; habit data; any spreadsheet a person keeps.

**Shape.** One AI tool and one Worksheets action, both through the
extension's single model route; a result lands as a new column or a
block, never silently overwriting data.

**Unknown.** Licence (TabPFN weights have had their own terms before);
size on disk; whether it runs on CPU in acceptable time; how it handles
dates and text columns.

### Generative edits in the Image Editor

**His words:** "I like the idea of generative edits."

**What it is.** Qwen-Image-2.1 unifies text-to-image and instruction
image editing in one open model; Iris-3B is pixel-space restoration and
super-resolution. The extension: a Generate step beside Enhance: inpaint
a masked region, edit by instruction, extend a canvas, all local on his
5090. Iris is a comparison against SeedVR2 (the current Enhance winner),
not a replacement until measured.

**Shape.** Reuses the editor's masks (step 2 of the mask work) as the
inpaint region; one model route; results as a new layer or a new copy,
never over the original.

**Unknown.** Licences; VRAM at his image sizes; speed per edit; ComfyUI
stays off the table (decided earlier, do not re-raise).

## Verification owed

Shipped work he has not yet judged, and measurements not yet taken.

- Re-measure on gemma4:31b at 64K, owed since 2026-11-09: the writing
  styles after the room change (words a reply, replies showing a thought),
  and the two knowledge cases (father, daughter, chef; the two strangers).
- His verdict in the app: Style Text and Start Custom From This; the
  per-character direction lists in Chat Settings; a generated sheet on
  Gemma and Qwen.

## Heard, not on the list

Recorded so they are not proposed again as new.

- **Extract To Table (GLiNER2.5):** "Not really sure how useful this one
  is." Off unless he brings it back.
- **Research Desk (Papers With Code inside Parallx):** "I like the idea,
  but not as a native." If it comes, it is an extension, never core.
  The pwc-cli SKILL.md could be loaded as a chat skill with no build.
- **Story tab writing style** (the Story tab uses no writing preset,
  only chats do): removed by him, 2026-11-10.
- **A trash for files, or one Trash for pages and files:** his own
  thought of 2026-11-09, removed by him, 2026-11-10. Files still go to
  the Recycle Bin on the same volume and are deleted in place on another.
- Music generation (ACE-Step 1.5, YuE2): not offered; next to the
  rejected soundscape round of 2026-09.
