# OpenClaw Integration Gap Matrix

**Date:** 2026-03-25  
**Input:** `OPENCLAW_REFERENCE_SOURCE_MAP.md`, `OPENCLAW_PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md`, `OPENCLAW_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md`  
**Purpose:** For each upstream capability, document what Parallx has, what's wrong, and what the fix is.

---

## Gap Classification

- **MISSING** — Upstream has it, Parallx doesn't
- **HEURISTIC** — Parallx has something, but it's regex/hardcoded patchwork, not derived from upstream
- **MISALIGNED** — Parallx has a related capability but it doesn't match upstream patterns
- **ALIGNED** — Parallx has it and it's structurally correct
- **N/A** — Upstream has it but Parallx doesn't need it (multi-channel, gateway, etc.)

## 1. Execution Pipeline

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-layer pipeline (L1→L2→L3→L4) | agent-runner.ts → attempt.ts | **MISSING** | `runOpenclawDefaultTurn` — flat single function | No separation of concerns. All pipeline stages merged into one function. | Refactor into layered functions: entry → retry/fallback → model resolution → attempt execution. Parallx doesn't need all 4 layers but needs at minimum: entry, retry-with-compaction, and attempt. |
| Queue policy / steer check (L1) | agent-runner.ts:97-140 | **N/A** | — | Not needed for single-user desktop app | Skip — no multi-user concurrency |
| Context overflow retry (L2) | agent-runner-execution.ts:113-380 | **MISSING** | — | No retry on context overflow. Request either succeeds or fails. | Add context overflow detection + compaction + retry loop. Upstream retries up to `MAX_OVERFLOW_COMPACTION_ATTEMPTS=3`. |
| Transient HTTP error retry (L2) | agent-runner-execution.ts (2500ms delay) | **MISSING** | — | No transient error handling. Ollama failures are terminal. | Add transient error detection + delay + retry. Even for localhost Ollama, transient failures occur. |
| Model fallback (L2) | model-fallback.ts:759-785 | **MISSING** | — | No model fallback. Single model, no failover. | Add model fallback support. When gpt-oss:20b fails, try configured backup model. |
| Session lane concurrency (L3) | run.ts:215-250 | **N/A** | — | Desktop app runs one turn at a time | Skip — single-user |
| Global lane concurrency (L3) | run.ts:250-270 | **N/A** | — | Same as above | Skip |
| Auth profile rotation (L3) | run.ts:371-619 | **N/A** | — | Single local Ollama, no API keys | Skip — but adopt retry pattern |
| Model resolution (L3) | run.ts:255-370 | **MISALIGNED** | `services.getActiveModel()` | Model is resolved from UI settings, not from agent config | Acceptable — Parallx model selection is UI-driven by design |
| Main retry loop (L3) | run.ts:879-1860 | **MISSING** | — | No top-level retry loop wrapping the attempt | Add simplified retry loop: attempt → check for overflow/timeout → compact → retry |
| Workspace/sandbox setup (L4) | attempt.ts:1672-1700 | **ALIGNED** | Bootstrap file loading | Workspace files loaded via `loadOpenclawBootstrapEntries` | Acceptable |
| Skill loading (L4) | attempt.ts:1692-1743 | **MISALIGNED** | Skills exist in `.parallx/skills/` | Skills loaded but not integrated into tool creation | Wire skill entries to tool definitions |
| System prompt construction (L4) | `buildEmbeddedSystemPrompt` | **MISALIGNED** | `buildOpenclawPromptArtifacts` | Ad-hoc concatenation of bootstrap sections. No structured builder. System prompt placeholder in envelope. | Implement structured system prompt builder that combines: workspace context, tool descriptions, skill prompts, runtime metadata, model capabilities |
| Tool creation (L4) | `createOpenClawCodingTools` | **MISALIGNED** | `services.getToolDefinitions()` | Tools provided by service layer, no tool creation logic | Acceptable for Parallx — tools are registered by the platform |
| Session management (L4) | `SessionManager`, `createAgentSession` | **MISALIGNED** | Chat session via platform | No explicit session manager or agent session lifecycle | Add session lifecycle: create → configure → execute → finalize |
| Ollama num_ctx injection (L4) | `wrapOllamaCompatNumCtx` | **MISSING** | — | No num_ctx injection for Ollama API calls | Add num_ctx injection. This is CRITICAL — without it, Ollama uses default context window which may be too small. |
| Context engine bootstrap (L4) | `runAttemptContextEngineBootstrap` | **MISSING** | — | No context engine bootstrap step | Add bootstrap step that initializes context state per attempt |
| Context engine assembly (L4) | `assembleAttemptContextEngine` | **MISSING** | — | No per-attempt context assembly with token budget | Add context assembly that respects token budget |
| Context engine finalization (L4) | Finalize turn | **MISSING** | — | No finalization step to persist context state | Add finalization to commit context mutations |

## 2. Context Engine

*Audited 2026-03-27 — see `docs/F2_CONTEXT_ENGINE_AUDIT.md` for full findings.*

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ContextEngine interface | context-engine/types.ts:74-231 | **ALIGNED** | `openclawContextEngine.ts` — `IOpenclawContextEngine` | Interface implemented with bootstrap/assemble/compact/afterTurn lifecycle. Maps upstream maintain→compact. | — |
| Context engine init | context-engine/init.ts | **ALIGNED** | `openclawDefaultParticipant.ts` L263 + `openclawTurnRunner.ts` L87-98 | Engine created per-turn, bootstrap() called once before retry loop. Equivalent of `ensureContextEnginesInitialized`. | — |
| Context engine registry | context-engine/registry.ts | **ALIGNED** | Direct instantiation in `buildOpenclawTurnContext()` | Single engine for desktop app — no registry needed. Documented N/A adaptation. | — |
| Context maintenance | context-engine-maintenance.ts | **ALIGNED** | `openclawContextEngine.ts` `maintain()` + `compact()` | maintain() implements 3 rules (trim verbose tool results, remove ack pairs, collapse duplicate summaries). compact() handles emergency summarization. Generation counter tracks both for assemble() detection. | — |
| Per-attempt helpers | attempt.context-engine-helpers.ts | **ALIGNED** | Inlined in `openclawTurnRunner.ts` and `openclawAttempt.ts` | Bootstrap + assembly calls inlined — functionally correct, factoring unnecessary for single-engine desktop model. ACCEPTED as pragmatic alignment. | — |
| Token budget management | Context engine assembly | **ALIGNED** | `openclawTokenBudget.ts` `computeElasticBudget()` wired in `assemble()` | Elastic budget redistributes surplus from underused lanes (system, history, user) to RAG. Demand-driven allocation with ceiling clamps and sum ≤ total invariant. | — |

## 3. Memory & Search

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory manager | memory/manager.ts | **MISALIGNED** | `services.recallMemories` / `services.storeSessionMemory` | Memory exists via service layer but lacks structured manager | Acceptable for now — service layer abstraction is fine |
| Hybrid search | memory/search-manager.ts | **MISALIGNED** | RAG via `services.retrieveContext` | Vector + keyword search via platform, not standalone | Acceptable — platform handles this |
| Embedding (Ollama) | memory/embeddings.ts:100-150 | **ALIGNED** | nomic-embed-text via Ollama | Configured in ai-config.json | Acceptable |
| Memory flush on compaction | Triggered by context compaction | **MISSING** | — | No automatic memory persistence on compaction | Add memory flush as part of compaction cycle |
| Session transcript persistence | sessions/*.jsonl | **MISALIGNED** | Platform session storage | Transcripts stored by platform, not as JSONL files | Acceptable — different storage backend is fine |

---

## 4. Routing & Turn Classification

*Audited and closed 2026-03-27 — see `docs/F5_ROUTING_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` for full findings.*

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Route resolution | routing/resolve-route.ts | **ALIGNED** | Slash commands + mode selection only | Regex routing cascades removed (F5 audit). Routes by structural signals only. | — |
| Off-topic detection | `OPENCLAW_OFF_TOPIC_DOMAIN_TERMS` | **ALIGNED** | Removed (F5 audit) | Keyword regex detection removed. Model handles off-topic via system prompt boundaries. | — |
| Conversational detection | `OPENCLAW_CONVERSATIONAL_PATTERNS` | **ALIGNED** | Removed (F5 audit) | Regex detection removed. Dead route kinds (`'conversational'`, `'product-semantics'`, `'off-topic'`) removed from openclaw types. | — |
| Product semantics Q&A | `buildOpenclawProductSemanticsAnswer` | **ALIGNED** | Removed (F5 audit) | Hardcoded deterministic answers deleted. Model answers from context. | — |
| Broad workspace summary | `BROAD_WORKSPACE_SUMMARY_PATTERNS` | **ALIGNED** | Removed (F5 audit) | Regex-triggered semantic fallback removed. `chatSemanticFallback.ts` deleted. `tryHandleWorkspaceDocumentListing` deleted. | — |

---

## 5. Response Quality

*Audited 2026-03-27 — see F6 audit report for full findings.*

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model produces correct output | Proper system prompt + context | **ALIGNED** | Output repair layer removed (F5/F6/F7 audits). `buildExtractiveFallback` removed (F6). No post-processing of model content. | All output repair functions removed. Model output used as-is. When model returns empty, the fix is better inputs (system prompt, context), not output repair. | — |
| Deterministic workflow answers | — (upstream doesn't have this) | **ALIGNED** | Removed (F5 audit). `buildDeterministicWorkflowAnswer` and `buildOpenclawProductSemanticsAnswer` deleted. | Deterministic answer bypass fully removed. Model handles all responses. | — |
| Evidence sufficiency scoring | — (Parallx adaptation) | **ALIGNED** | `openclawResponseValidation.ts` `assessEvidence()` → `openclawContextEngine.ts` `assemble()` | Simplified to domain-agnostic quality signal. Used as INPUT shaping (constraint injection into system prompt), not output repair. Insurance-domain hardcoding (`extractCoverageFocusTerms`, `roleBonus`) removed. | — |
| Citation attribution | — | **ALIGNED** | `openclawResponseValidation.ts` `validateCitations()` | Structural citation index remapping. No content rewriting. | — |

---

## 6. System Prompt

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Structured prompt builder | `buildEmbeddedSystemPrompt` | **MISALIGNED** | `buildOpenclawPromptArtifacts` | Bootstrap files concatenated as sections. No structured prompt with capabilities, rules, model metadata. | Implement structured system prompt builder: identity section → workspace context → tool descriptions → behavioral rules → response format rules |
| Workspace bootstrap | `resolveBootstrapContextForRun` | **ALIGNED** | `loadOpenclawBootstrapEntries` + `buildOpenclawBootstrapContext` | Bootstrap files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.) loaded with budget limits | Acceptable |
| Skill-to-prompt mapping | Skills in system prompt | **MISSING** | — | Skills loaded but not injected into system prompt | Wire skill manifests into prompt builder |
| Tool descriptions in prompt | Tools listed in system prompt | **MISALIGNED** | Tools provided via API, not in system prompt | OpenAI/Ollama tool format handles this, but explicit prompt tool descriptions improve local model compliance | Consider adding tool summary to system prompt for local models |

---

## 7. Tool Policy

*Audited and closed 2026-03-27 — see `docs/F4_TOOL_POLICY_AUDIT.md` for full findings.*

| Upstream Capability | Upstream Location | Parallx Status | Parallx Location | Gap | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-stage tool filtering | tool-policy.ts | **ALIGNED** | `openclawToolPolicy.ts` `applyOpenclawToolPolicy()` + `openclawToolState.ts` `buildOpenclawRuntimeToolState()` | 2-step pipeline (profile deny/allow + permission filter) implemented. Full upstream 6-step pipeline (per-agent, per-provider, per-group) N/A for single-user desktop. | — |
| Tool approval system | Session-level approval | **ALIGNED** | `IChatRuntimeAutonomyMirror` + `languageModelToolsService.ts` `invokeToolWithRuntimeControl()` | 3-tier permission enforcement: never-allowed excluded at policy level, requires-approval gated at invocation level, always-allowed passed through. | — |

## Priority-Ordered Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Heuristic Patchwork (HIGH — M40 mandate) ✅ COMPLETE
1. ~~**Remove output repair layer**~~ — Done (F5/F6/F7 audits). All `repair*`, `ensure*`, `buildExtractiveFallback`, `extractCoverageFocusTerms`, `roleBonus`, `scoreLine` removed.
2. ~~**Remove regex routing**~~ — Done (F5 audit). All routing term regex, turn interpretation cascades, off-topic/conversational detection removed.
3. ~~**Remove deterministic workflow answers**~~ — Done (F5 audit). `buildDeterministicWorkflowAnswer`, hardcoded source summaries removed.
4. **Remove product semantics hardcoded Q&A** — Delete `buildOpenclawProductSemanticsAnswer`

### Phase 2: Fix System Prompt (HIGH — root cause of output quality)
5. **Implement structured system prompt builder** — Replace placeholder with proper prompt that includes: identity, workspace context, behavioral rules, response format, citation rules, evidence handling
6. **Add tool descriptions to prompt** — Improve local model tool compliance
7. **Wire skills into prompt** — Map skill manifests to prompt sections

### Phase 3: Add Execution Pipeline (MEDIUM — reliability)
8. **Add retry with compaction** — Detect context overflow, compact, retry
9. **Add transient error handling** — Retry on Ollama connection/timeout errors
10. **Add Ollama num_ctx injection** — Critical for correct context window behavior
11. **Add model fallback** — Try backup model on primary failure

### Phase 4: Implement Context Engine (MEDIUM — architecture)
12. **Define IContextEngine interface** — Pluggable lifecycle contract
13. **Implement token budget manager** — System/RAG/History/User budget allocation
14. **Add context assembly per turn** — Budget-aware context building
15. **Add context compaction** — Automatic compaction when budget exceeded

### Phase 5: Clean Up Types (LOW — alignment)
16. **Align types with upstream contracts** — Update `openclawTypes.ts` to reflect actual upstream patterns
17. **Add tool policy** — Basic tool filtering by mode
18. **Simplify routing** — Route by slash command and mode, not by message content
